# steam-ds cookbook

This is an attempt at making a cookbook for dedicated servers on steam.

Unfortunately, the current version of vagrant that is stable at this time does
not allow port forwarding a port number with both TCP and UDP. This effectively
stops any vagrant testing in its tracks. In the meantime, guesswork abounds
unless I drop some cash for an Amazon box or something.
